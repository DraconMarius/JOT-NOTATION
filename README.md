## Installation & Usage
There are no installation needed for this application, just head on over to the heroku deployed link to give it a go!

There will be a landing page, where you will then be directed to the notes application, where you are able to recall notes that was already within our db.json

You can also type in the text field on the right, and click the save button to save your not to the server. 

Similarly, you can also delete those notes using the the trashcan icon that was provided.

## Method
I was asked to implement the express.js Routes that will allow user to initiate a fetch request with various method that will `POST`, `GET`, and `DELETE` from our database to store, get, and delete our notes.
